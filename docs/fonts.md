# Pixlet Fonts

Pixlet offers a couple of different fonts for rendering text. Which
one to use depends on the information being presented and the amount
of space available when rendering. Pixlet's `Text` Widget attempts to
draw the font on the baseline, i.e. offset upwards by the font's
descent. And if that sentence made no sense to you, read then next
section. =)

## Typography and Unicode refresher

Our most important Unicode block is Basic Latin (a.k.a. ASCII). We
also need at least the Latin-1 Supplement block (a.k.a. ISO 8859,
"Latin-1") to be able to render symbols like √ë, √Ñ and √ñ. These matter
a lot when displaying names of people, locations, etc.

The definitions in this graphic are helpful:

In addition to these, a glyph's _advance_ is the distance between its
"origin point", i.e. the leftmost point of the baseline, and the
following glyph.

A _cap height_ of 6 and a _descent_ of 1 is sufficient to fit both
upper and lower case A-Z, as well as the most common special
characters. From fiddling with fonts a bit, this seems to be the
minimum.

To cover Latin-1 Supplement, we need more space. At least one
additional pixel in the _ascent_ for characters with diacritics to be
legible.

## Unicode Emoji Support

The Pixlet Text widget automatically detects and renders Unicode emojis alongside regular text. You can include emojis directly in your text strings with any font:

```python
# Single emoji
render.Text("üòÄ", font="6x10")

# Multiple emojis
render.Text("üòÄüòÇüòçüòâüòé", font="5x8")

# Mixed text and emojis
render.Text("Hello üòÄ World!", font="tb-8")

# Flag emojis
render.Text("üá∫üá∏üá¨üáßüá´üá∑", font="6x10")
```

### How Emoji Rendering Works

- **Automatic Detection**: The Text widget automatically detects Unicode emoji sequences
- **Built-in Support**: Uses Pixlet's built-in emoji sprite sheet with 1753+ emojis
- **Seamless Integration**: Emojis render alongside text using any font
- **Standard Size**: All emojis render at 10x10 pixels regardless of text font

### Scalable Emojis

For large emojis or standalone emoji graphics, use the dedicated `render.Emoji` widget:

```python
# Create emojis at any size
render.Emoji(emoji="üöÄ", height=32)   # 32px tall rocket
render.Emoji(emoji="‚ö°", height=64)   # 64px tall lightning
```

The Emoji widget provides:
- **Custom sizing**: Any height from 1 to hundreds of pixels
- **High quality scaling**: Smooth interpolation for large sizes
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering at any scale

For a complete list of supported emojis and detailed usage, see [emoji.md](emoji.md).

## The fonts

Note that all of these are free or public domain fonts created by
others. Attribution is given for each below.

### tb-8

![tb-8 example](img/tb-8.gif)

A modified version of 5x8. This font has variable advance (i.e. it's
not mono-spaced) and slightly tweaked glyphs for improved
legibility. All digits are monospace with advance 5.

Like 5x8, this covers Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement, plus some
other latin glyphs.

All digits in tb-8 are monospaced 5x6, so rendering them with a
baseline offset of -1 and a height of 6 is perfectly fine and renders
the full glyphs without cropping.

Common numerical symbols ('+', '-', '/', '*', '=', '%', '.') also fit
in height 6 with offset -1. These are however all variable-width. Note
that ',' has descent 1 and won't fit in this case.

Currency symbols require full height in the general case, but euro
sign '‚Ç¨' and dollar sign '$' have no descent and fit in 7 pixels.

- Advance: 2-6
- Height: 8
- Cap height: 6
- Ascent: 7
- Descent: 1

### Terminus Variable
By [Dimitar Toshkov Zhekov](https://terminus-font.sourceforge.net/)

![Terminus Variable](img/terminus-variable.png)

Terminus Variable is a family of bitmap fonts that supports multiple pixel sizes. Each size ships in a normal weight, with matching light weight variants at 14px and larger. All styles include 1356 glyphs (ISO10646-1 coverage). Numeric glyphs, the colon, and the space character share the same width, so clock layouts and other tabular number displays stay aligned.
